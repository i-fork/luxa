Badges can indicate notifications, item counts, or other information related to navigation; these small UI elements convey important information at a glance.

<Recipe component={<Badge />} dirName="badge" />

> **Best Practices**
>
> - Clearly differentiate the badge from other content;
> - Keep badges brief and informative;
> - Ensure accessibility with `aria-label` for non-text badges.

Luxa CSS offers a meticulously curated colour palette optimized for both _sRGB_ and _P3_ colour spaces. This palette includes Neutrals for utility and hierarchy and Secondary Colours for semantic meaning and visual interest.

## Neutrals

Neutrals provide utility and hierarchy without competing with our core and secondary colours. These shades are essential for maintaining balance and focus in your design.

<div class="colors" title="Neutrals">
  <div class="col neutral-01" title="Neutral 01" />
  <div class="col neutral-02" title="Neutral 02" />
  <div class="col neutral-03" title="Neutral 03" />
  <div class="col neutral-04" title="Neutral 04" />
  <div class="col neutral-05" title="Neutral 05" />
  <div class="col neutral-06" title="Neutral 06" />
  <div class="col neutral-07" title="Neutral 07" />
  <div class="col neutral-08" title="Neutral 08" />
  <div class="col neutral-09" title="Neutral 09" />
  <div class="col neutral-10" title="Neutral 10" />
</div>

### Secondary Colours

Our secondary colours are designed to communicate semantic meaning and add visual interest to your projects. These colours are perfect for accents, highlights, and other design elements that require a pop of colour.

<div class="colors" title="Secondary Colours">
  <div class="col red" title="Red" />
  <div class="col orange" title="Orange" />
  <div class="col yellow" title="Yellow" />
  <div class="col green" title="Green" />
  <div class="col blue" title="Blue" />
  <div class="col purple" title="Purple" />
</div>

### What is the P3 Colour Space?

The _P3_ colour space offers a broader gamut of colours than _sRGB_, resulting in more affluent and vibrant hues. This allows for better display accuracy on supported devices, ensuring your designs look their best across screens.

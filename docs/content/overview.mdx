description: You only need one CSS file to use Luxa.
---

Luxa CSS is a CSS library. This means it provides CSS classes to help you style your HTML code.

By using Luxa CSS, you're starting with a clean and lightweight kit that prioritizes minimalism, speed, and ease of maintenance.

To use it, you can either:

- Use one of the pre-compiled `.css` files;
- Or install the `.scss` files so you can customize Luxa to your needs.

## Code requirements

For Luxa to work correctly, you need to make your webpage responsive.

1. Use the HTML5 `doctype` declaration;
2. Include the viewport meta tag in the `<head>` of your document.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>Hi üëãüèª Luxa!</title>
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/luxacss@1.0.8/dist/compressed/luxa.min.css"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <main class="container-80">
      <section class="row">
        <h1>Ol√° Mundo!</h1>
        <p>My first website with <strong>Luxa CSS</strong>!</p>
      </section>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

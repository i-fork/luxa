title: How to install Luxa
description: Install Luxa manually or via CDN for a dependency-free setup, or use NPM.

There are three ways to get started:

## Install manually

[Download the latest version](https://github.com/luxonauta/luxacss/archive/main.zip/?ref=luxacss.com) and link the CSS in the `<head>` of your website.

> The GitHub repository also includes this documentation, so it's significantly bigger than the NPM package.

### Install from CDN

Alternatively, you can easily include Luxa CSS in your project using a CDN. Choose the version that suits your needs:

```html
<!-- 🦣 Expanded - 8KB -->
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/luxacss@1.0.8/dist/expanded/luxa.css"
/>

<!-- 🦐 Compressed - 6KB -->
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/luxacss@1.0.8/dist/compressed/luxa.min.css"
/>
```

### Install with a package manager

```bash
npm i luxacss

pnpm i luxacss

bun i luxacss
```

Then import it into your main layout/page:

```jsx
import "luxacss";
```

Or, import Luxa into your `.scss` file with [`@use`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use/?ref=luxacss.com):

```scss
@use "luxacss";
```

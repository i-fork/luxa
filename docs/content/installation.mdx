description: Install Luxa manually or via CDN for a dependency-free setup, or use NPM.
---

Choose the method that best suits your project:

## CDN (quickest)

Add one of these lines to your HTML `<head>`:

```html
<!-- Expanded (8KB) -->
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/luxacss@latest/dist/expanded/luxa.css"
/>

<!-- Compressed (6KB) -->
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/luxacss@latest/dist/compressed/luxa.min.css"
/>
```

### Manual download

1. [Download the latest version](https://github.com/luxonauta/luxacss/archive/main.zip/?ref=luxacss.com);
2. Extract the CSS file you need;
3. Link it in your HTML `<head>`.

**Note**: The GitHub repository includes documentation, making it larger than the NPM package.

#### Package manager

Install using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install luxacss

pnpm add luxacss

bun add luxacss
```

##### Usage with JavaScript bundlers (e.g., Webpack, Rollup)

Import the CSS file in your JavaScript entry point:

```js
import "luxacss";
```

> The package manager method is recommended for projects using modern JavaScript frameworks or build tools, as it allows for better integration and customization.

##### Usage with Sass

If you're using Sass in your project, you can import Luxa CSS like this:

```scss
@use "luxacss";
// or
@use "luxacss" as *;
```

This allows you to use Luxa CSS variables, mixins, and functions in your Sass files.

##### Usage with Next.js

For Next.js projects, you can import Luxa CSS in your `_app.js` or `layout.js` file:

```js
import "luxacss";
```

#### Customization

To customize Luxa CSS variables or use specific parts of the library, you can import individual modules:

```scss
// Import other modules as needed
@use "luxacss/variables" as vars;
@use "luxacss/grid" as grid;
```

Choose the method that best fits your development workflow and project
requirements. ðŸ˜Š

title: Responsiveness
description: Built to be responsive with a fluid design approach.
---

Luxa utilises a fluid design approach for fonts, spacing, and fixed container breakpoints. This proportional and fluid sizing system ensures visual consistency across different devices.

> Luxa is not mobile-first. While every element is responsive, the design defaults to horizontal reading. For instance, `columns` are stacked horizontally; however, you can enforce a vertical layout for columns or other classes by appending modifiers.

For more details regarding fixed breakpoints, see [Grid](/docs/grid).

### Ensure that Git does not track certain files and directories, including node artifacts, system files, and logs.

## Node artifacts
### Prevent `node_modules` directories from being tracked by Git to reduce clutter and avoid version conflicts across environments.
node_modules/

### Avoid tracking `package-lock.json` to prevent conflicts between different npm installs.
package_lock.json

## System-specific files
### Files created by OS that aren't relevant to the project's functionality.
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

## Documentation-specific rules for the 'docs/' directory

/docs/package-lock.json
